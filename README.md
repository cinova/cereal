*An LFE NIF for serial port communications*

<img src="resources/images/johnny-automatic-cereal-box-and-milk-small.png /">

The LFE code in this app was converted from the Erlang code from which this
repo was forked. It has since been updated with additional functions, so the
APIs differ.

The C used in this app was inspired by and in some cases
copy/pasted from https://github.com/tonyg/erlang-serial
